Over 27 years, I've migrated systems from VB6 to .NET, Classic ASP to Node.js, and monoliths to microservices. I've seen migrations succeed spectacularly and fail catastrophically. The difference isn't the tech—it's the strategy.

Here's everything I've learned about migrating legacy systems to modern architectures without destroying your business in the process.

## The Big Rewrite is a Trap

The most tempting and most dangerous migration strategy: "Let's rewrite from scratch!"

### Why Rewrites Fail

1. **Business keeps evolving**: By the time you finish, requirements changed
2. **Hidden complexity**: Legacy code contains years of bug fixes and edge cases
3. **No feedback loop**: Can't release until complete
4. **Team burnout**: Rewriting existing functionality is demoralizing
5. **Opportunity cost**: 2 years building, 0 years shipping features

I've seen companies spend 3 years on rewrites, only to abandon them and go back to the legacy system.

### The Strangler Fig Pattern

Instead of rewriting, gradually replace:

```
Legacy System (100% traffic)
    ↓
Legacy (90%) + New (10%)
    ↓
Legacy (50%) + New (50%)
    ↓
Legacy (10%) + New (90%)
    ↓
New System (100% traffic)
```

Named after strangler fig vines that eventually replace their host tree.

## Step 1: Add a Routing Layer

Route requests between legacy and new systems:

```typescript
// api-gateway/router.ts
import express from 'express';
import { createProxyMiddleware } from 'http-proxy-middleware';

const app = express();

// Feature flags determine routing
const featureFlags = {
  'new-projects-api': {
    enabled: true,
    rolloutPercentage: 20, // 20% of traffic
  },
};

app.use('/api/projects', (req, res, next) => {
  const useNewSystem =
    featureFlags['new-projects-api'].enabled &&
    Math.random() < featureFlags['new-projects-api'].rolloutPercentage / 100;

  if (useNewSystem) {
    // Route to new system
    createProxyMiddleware({
      target: 'http://new-api:3000',
      changeOrigin: true,
    })(req, res, next);
  } else {
    // Route to legacy system
    createProxyMiddleware({
      target: 'http://legacy-api:8080',
      changeOrigin: true,
    })(req, res, next);
  }
});

// Legacy system handles everything else
app.use('/', createProxyMiddleware({
  target: 'http://legacy-api:8080',
  changeOrigin: true,
}));
```

Start at 1% traffic, gradually increase. Roll back instantly if issues arise.

## Step 2: Create Anti-Corruption Layer

Legacy systems have weird data models. Don't let that leak into new code.

```typescript
// legacy-adapter/project-adapter.ts
export class LegacyProjectAdapter {
  // Legacy system returns bizarre format
  fromLegacy(legacyProject: any): Project {
    return {
      id: legacyProject.PROJECT_ID,
      name: legacyProject.NAME,
      status: this.mapStatus(legacyProject.STATUS_CODE),
      clientId: legacyProject.CLIENT_FK,
      budget: parseFloat(legacyProject.BUDGET_AMT || '0'),
      createdAt: new Date(legacyProject.CREATED_DATE),
      // Map 20+ weird fields to clean domain model
    };
  }

  // Clean model to legacy format
  toLegacy(project: Project): any {
    return {
      PROJECT_ID: project.id,
      NAME: project.name,
      STATUS_CODE: this.unmapStatus(project.status),
      CLIENT_FK: project.clientId,
      BUDGET_AMT: project.budget.toString(),
      CREATED_DATE: project.createdAt.toISOString(),
    };
  }

  private mapStatus(legacyStatus: string): ProjectStatus {
    const mapping: Record<string, ProjectStatus> = {
      'A': 'active',
      'C': 'completed',
      'H': 'on-hold',
      'X': 'cancelled',
    };
    return mapping[legacyStatus] || 'active';
  }
}
```

New code only sees clean `Project` domain model. Legacy weirdness is isolated.

## Step 3: Dual-Write Strategy

Write to both systems during migration:

```typescript
export class ProjectService {
  constructor(
    private legacyAdapter: LegacyProjectAdapter,
    private newRepository: ProjectRepository,
    private featureFlags: FeatureFlagService
  ) {}

  async create(dto: CreateProjectDTO): Promise<Project> {
    // Create in new system
    const project = await this.newRepository.create(dto);

    if (this.featureFlags.isEnabled('dual-write-projects')) {
      try {
        // Also write to legacy system for consistency
        await this.legacyAdapter.create(project);
      } catch (error) {
        // Log but don't fail - new system is source of truth
        logger.error('Failed to sync to legacy', error);
      }
    }

    return project;
  }
}
```

Both systems stay in sync. When migration is complete, remove dual writes.

## Step 4: Migrate Data Incrementally

Don't migrate all data at once. Do it in phases:

```typescript
// migration-scripts/migrate-projects.ts
async function migrateProjects() {
  let offset = 0;
  const batchSize = 1000;

  while (true) {
    // Fetch batch from legacy
    const legacyProjects = await legacyDB.query(
      `SELECT * FROM PROJECTS LIMIT ${batchSize} OFFSET ${offset}`
    );

    if (legacyProjects.length === 0) break;

    // Transform and insert into new system
    const projects = legacyProjects.map(p => adapter.fromLegacy(p));

    await newDB.insert(projects).values(projects);

    console.log(`Migrated ${offset + legacyProjects.length} projects`);

    offset += batchSize;

    // Don't overload database
    await sleep(1000);
  }
}
```

Run during off-hours. If it fails, restart from last offset.

## Step 5: Validate Data Consistency

Ensure both systems return same data:

```typescript
async function validateProjects() {
  const projectIds = await getRandomProjectIds(100);

  for (const id of projectIds) {
    const legacyProject = await legacyAPI.getProject(id);
    const newProject = await newAPI.getProject(id);

    const legacyNormalized = adapter.fromLegacy(legacyProject);

    if (!deepEqual(legacyNormalized, newProject)) {
      logger.error('Data mismatch', {
        projectId: id,
        legacy: legacyNormalized,
        new: newProject,
        diff: diff(legacyNormalized, newProject),
      });
    }
  }
}

// Run hourly in production
setInterval(validateProjects, 60 * 60 * 1000);
```

Catches data inconsistencies early.

## Step 6: Feature Parity Testing

Ensure new system can do everything legacy does:

```typescript
describe('Project API Parity', () => {
  it('should support all legacy query parameters', async () => {
    const legacyQueries = [
      '/projects?status=active',
      '/projects?client_id=123',
      '/projects?sort=name&order=desc',
      '/projects?search=website',
    ];

    for (const query of legacyQueries) {
      const legacyResponse = await legacyAPI.get(query);
      const newResponse = await newAPI.get(query);

      expect(newResponse.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
      expect(newResponse).toMatchSchema(legacyResponse);
    }
  });

  it('should maintain backward compatibility', async () => {
    // New API accepts both old and new formats
    const oldFormat = { project_id: '123', project_name: 'Test' };
    const newFormat = { id: '123', name: 'Test' };

    await expect(newAPI.create(oldFormat)).resolves.toBeDefined();
    await expect(newAPI.create(newFormat)).resolves.toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

## Real-World Migration: OneTravel.com

When I worked on OneTravel.com, we migrated from a .NET monolith to Node.js microservices.

### Our Approach

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Infrastructure**
- Set up new Node.js services
- Create API gateway for routing
- Build anti-corruption layer

**Phase 2 (Months 4-9): Migrate Features**
- Month 4: Search (10% traffic, then 100%)
- Month 6: Booking (5% traffic, then 100%)
- Month 8: User accounts (20% traffic, then 100%)

**Phase 3 (Months 10-12): Data Migration**
- Migrate historical data
- Validate consistency
- Remove dual writes

**Phase 4 (Month 13): Decommission Legacy**
- Turn off old system
- Celebrate!

### What Worked

1. **Gradual rollout**: Caught issues with 1% traffic, not 100%
2. **Feature flags**: Instant rollback if problems
3. **Parallel running**: Legacy was fallback for 6 months
4. **Team buy-in**: Shipped features in new system early, kept team motivated

### What Didn't

1. **Underestimated data**: Data migration took 3x longer than expected
2. **Hidden dependencies**: Discovered 15+ integrations we didn't know about
3. **Performance testing**: New system was slower initially, needed optimization

## Migration Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Big Bang Deployment

```
❌ Friday 5pm: Switch everyone to new system
❌ Monday 9am: Everything breaks
❌ Tuesday: Roll back, project cancelled
```

Always migrate gradually with rollback capability.

### 2. Ignoring Edge Cases

```typescript
// ❌ "The legacy system checks for null, but we'll use TypeScript so it's fine"

// Reality: Legacy system has data like this:
{
  project_name: null,        // Should be impossible
  status: 'Q',               // Undocumented status
  budget: 'TBD',             // Number field with string?!
  created_date: '0000-00-00' // Invalid date
}
```

Legacy systems contain years of edge cases. Handle them.

### 3. Assuming Perfect Documentation

Legacy systems are never documented. Plan for discovery:

```typescript
// Document as you migrate
async function migrateProjects() {
  const projects = await legacyDB.query('SELECT * FROM PROJECTS');

  // Discover actual data
  const statusValues = new Set(projects.map(p => p.STATUS_CODE));
  console.log('Found status values:', statusValues);
  // Output: Set { 'A', 'C', 'H', 'X', 'P', 'Q', '?' }
  //         ^ What's 'P', 'Q', '?'? Not documented!
}
```

### 4. No Rollback Plan

```typescript
// ✅ Always have killswitch
const config = {
  useNewSystem: process.env.USE_NEW_SYSTEM === 'true',
  rolloutPercentage: parseInt(process.env.ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE || '0'),
};

// Can change these via environment variables instantly
```

## Tools and Techniques

### Database Migration Tools

- **Flyway**: Version-controlled SQL migrations
- **Liquibase**: Database-agnostic migrations
- **Prisma Migrate**: TypeScript-first migrations

### Feature Flags

- **LaunchDarkly**: Enterprise feature flags
- **Unleash**: Open-source feature flags
- **Custom solution**: Simple flag service in database

### Monitoring

Track both systems during migration:

```typescript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';

async function getProject(id: string) {
  const transaction = Sentry.startTransaction({
    op: 'project.get',
    name: 'Get Project',
  });

  try {
    const useNew = shouldUseNewSystem();

    const span = transaction.startChild({
      op: 'db.query',
      description: useNew ? 'New System' : 'Legacy System',
    });

    const result = useNew
      ? await newAPI.getProject(id)
      : await legacyAPI.getProject(id);

    span.finish();

    return result;
  } finally {
    transaction.finish();
  }
}
```

Compare performance and error rates between systems.

## When to Give Up and Rewrite

Sometimes rewrites are necessary:

- **Technology is dead**: VB6, Flash, Silverlight
- **No one understands it**: Original developers gone, no documentation
- **Can't be maintained**: Every change breaks something
- **Security holes**: Unfixable vulnerabilities
- **Performance is unfixable**: Architecture is fundamentally flawed

But even then, consider strangler pattern first.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Migrate gradually**: Small batches, feature flags, rollback capability
2. **Legacy has hidden complexity**: Plan for 3x more edge cases than you expect
3. **Both systems will run in parallel**: For months or years
4. **Data migration is hardest**: Allocate 40% of time to data
5. **Feature parity first**: New system must do everything legacy does
6. **Monitor everything**: Compare performance, errors, data consistency
7. **Team needs wins**: Ship features in new system early to maintain morale

## Conclusion

Migrating legacy systems to modern architectures is one of the hardest things in software engineering. The key is avoiding the big rewrite trap and using the strangler pattern: gradually replace the old system with the new, one piece at a time.

After 27 years and countless migrations, I've learned that successful migrations aren't about perfect code or cutting-edge tech—they're about incremental progress, careful validation, and always having a rollback plan.

The best migration is the one that's so gradual, users never notice it happened.
